# 911-Calls-Data-Analysis-Visualisation
This is a small project I had done as a part of my course on Data Science
For this project I had taken a data set of some 911 calls on Kaggle and done Analysis and Visualisation of the data using the instructions that were given in the notebook for the course.
I had made use of Python Libraries like Numpy and Pandas for Data Analysis and Matplotlib and Seaborn for Data Visualisation
